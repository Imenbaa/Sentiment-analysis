I apply it in the morning before going to school and it doesn't look too noticeable. If you want a darker color to make it stand out, you will have to apply it 2-3 times. It still looks great and doesn't cause any irritation and surprisingly lasts me through the whole day. I also love how easy it is for me to take it off without any eyelashes falling off. Just wash your face with warm water and pat your eyelashes with a small napkin or towel and your natural eyelashes will be fine. I highly recommend this product!\"\n",
