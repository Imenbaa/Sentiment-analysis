I am surprised it applies so evenly without the need for second application, and it is BOLD. Extremely pigmented. It’s also buildable, but there’s no need for a second coat. I learned from other reviews that you should try to go on light so it will dry faster. I haven’t had issues with drying though. Just keep your lips parted until it sets, then you can close your mouth.

I was starting to panic, until my friend reminded me that I could use coconut oil. I’ve eaten dinner and drank directly from cups with this lipstick on. Everything from rice with chopsticks to pizza. It still looks great afterwards. You might see a little transfer on your cup or straw, but your lips will not reflect this. They will stay bold and matte without the need for reapplication. (Note: I probably wouldn't wear it to a hot dog eating contest";" I am still fairly careful with my lipstick when I eat, and I barely let anything touch my lips if I can help it.
