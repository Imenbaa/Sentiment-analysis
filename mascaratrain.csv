So after reading many reviews I decided to order this mascara and wait nearly two weeks for it to come back in stock so I could have those voluminous  lashes you see on Instagram. After the first coat...then the second...reality set in. While this did a decent job applying and making my tiny lashes slightly more noticeable. It also was slightly more clumpy than I expected but that could have been because of the waterproof formula. This didn\'t make me jump out of my seat with awe and start taking a million selfies but it made my lashes stand out more than my natural lashes would have. My only serious gripe about this product is how difficult it was to remove. It lasted all day for sure but when it came time to remove my makeup at night normal makeup remover would not take it off and my lashes became sticky. The only way to remove it was to use a serious oil based cleanser and rub my eyes like crazy...then go back in with a micellar wipe.

The volume is buildable depending on how many coats you apply. The wand is big enough to create the desired volume effect, but small enough to keep the eyelids clean and free from mistakes. It retails for about $10.00, which is a bit high for drugstore mascara, but it works so well that I don’t mind. As I’m sure you know, a lot of people are saying that this mascara is a dupe for the Too Faced BTS mascara and I agree that it is a good dupe. You can definitely achieve the same lash effects with both of these mascaras. A couple of differences between the two would be: the L’Oreal mascara’s formula is a bit thinner and a lot less clumpy than the Too Faced mascara, the brush is similar in shape but a bit smaller, the price difference (L’Oreal $10.00 and Too Faced BTS $23.00), and the L’Oreal tube itself feels a lot lighter compared to the Too Faced mascara. The similarities include: the final lash effects, the amount of lash volume that can be obtained, the packaging (same shiny pink color) and a similar wand. If I had to pick between the two, I would definitely pick the L’Oreal mascara. This was my choice because I really liked that the L’Oreal mascara is far less clumpy and heavy, the dramatic price difference, and the fact that you can achieve the same look with a drugstore product.

After wearing it for a few hours, I can expect to see dark residue on the bottom of my eyes, and I usually need to forcefully wipe it off with my fingers. Also, the mascara doesn't last quite as long as I'd hoped. After a few hours, I can see my lashes getting thinner and more sparse. The wand is also very big, so applying often results in smudges on my lids. While it creates nice volume, it doesn't really help with length. Still, it works above average for a drugstore mascara. However, beware that you may need to reapply and/or check for under-eye smudging after several hours.""""]"",['Smudging expected']";;;;

Overall it gives a natural look but does thicken and extend lashes.  I believe the secret to a natural look is to have a scant amount of product on the brush.  I save brushes and clean them so that you are not forced to use the brush that comes with a new tube, which is usually to overfull of product.  You could wipe the new brush off, but that seems wasteful.  So I swap out the new brush for a fresh old brush and avoid the clumping that would otherwise occur.  As the tube is less full I start using the new brush, which I have stored safely.  Your mileage may vary, but I find this works perfectly to avoid matted eyelashes.  Clean old brushes are also great for brushing and straightening brows.  Instead of paying dollars for a brow brush just wash your old mascara brush, it works perfectly and the price is right.

Everyone to whom I've recommended this mascara now swears by it, too! After I curl my lashes, I put a few coats of this mascara and it holds well, dries fairly quickly, and volumizes my lashes. Initially, the mascara is a bit more tacky and you'll need to scrape some mascara goo (I don't know the exact name of it) off before using it. It's the same toward the end, too, the goo tends to clump on the wand because there's not much left, so you'll need to do a bit of scraping. After every few uses, I scrape off the entire wand to prevent the goo from drying and flaking... if you're having flaky clumps this is the reason!!! Clean that crap up and you'll be good to go. One thing I would recommend is using an oil-based makeup remover to take off this makeup. DO NOT USE WIPES. DO NOT USE YOUR TWO-IN-ONE MAKEUP REMOVER/CLEANSER.

"6,['4.0 out of 5 stars'],""[""""This mascara is a cult favourite. I've heard loads of good things, and it's for good reason... But there IS a slight learning curve with how to apply it without falling victim to the undesirable spider lash look. For reference, I have stick-straight, average length lashes. First, I would use a primer. If you apply more than one layer, the mascara tends to flake off. Since it's such a wet formula, the flakes immediately smudge and will NOT come off without makeup remover. This is inconvenient if you wear a full face of foundation and concealer. Next, I would recommend combing through each layer of mascara using a metal eyelash comb. As mentioned earlier, it's quite a wet formula, and chunks tend to accumulate at the ends of lashes if any extra mascara isn't removed.

However, the brush comes out with a ton of product on it and I have to wipe it off to use it.

But the thing about a waterproof formula is it's hard to add several coats.  It dries so fast that when you try to apply more, it simply clumps up.  So I decided to try Loreal's Voluminous formula, which reviews have said doesn't smudge.  The mascara is somewhat wet so it takes a few minutes to dry, which means that additional coats can be done.  I do two coats and then use the waterproof formula for a third coat which seals everything.  I don't know if I'd buy this mascara again.  It's hard to say.  I don't wear mascara every day so I'm expecting it to dry out somewhat.  The brush (once it's wiped off that is) does build volume and does a fair job of separating lashes.

The only other mascara that I would rank above this one is the Diorshow Waterproof Mascara, HOWEVER I'm not willing to drop $25+ 3 times a year (4 months is the average lifespan of my mascaras) for tubes of black stuff. For under $10, this tube is wonderful. I must always use a drier waterproof formula to hold any bit of curl that I put on my lashes. This one does it perfectly for me.  Everyone to whom I've recommended this mascara now swears by it, too! After I curl my lashes, I put a few coats of this mascara and it holds well, dries fairly quickly, and volumizes my lashes. Initially, the mascara is a bit more tacky and you'll need to scrape some mascara goo (I don't know the exact name of it) off before using it. It's the same toward the end, too, the goo tends to clump on the wand because there's not much left, so you'll need to do a bit of scraping. After every few uses, I scrape off the entire wand to prevent the goo from drying and flaking... if you're having flaky clumps this is the reason!!! Clean that crap up and you'll be good to go. One thing I would recommend is using an oil-based makeup remover to take off this makeup. DO NOT USE WIPES. DO NOT USE YOUR TWO-IN-ONE MAKEUP REMOVER/CLEANSER. You will damage your eye skin, lashes, and still have makeup leftover. Please do yourself a favor and get a decent makeup remover if you're going to use this or else don't blame the mascara for doing exactly what it's supposed to do... staying on your lashes.

I'd give it about 6-8 hours before you experience flakes on your undereyes. I've had flakes every single day at the end of the day. It wasn't too much of a mess, but the blue flakes were noticable. It's also very easy to clean. A baby wipe works just fine.""""]"",['👍']";;;;

"9,['5.0 out of 5 stars'],""['I was always in search of a mascara that could withstand humidity and oily eyelids.  Back in the late 2000s I heard of the new Japanese “beauty tubes” technology for mascara formulations.  I believe the first to come out was Sheshiedo’s and it was not only expensive but sold out everywhere.  I couldn’t wait to get my hands on this type of mascara because I have always had hooded “bedroom eyes” plus oily lids so eyeshadow always creased and mascara alway bled, giving me raccoon eyes.  I usually skipped eye makeup altogether or just used eyeliner.  Until!  Around 10 years ago L’Oreal parted the heavens and rained down the perfect affordable mascara with the beauty tubes formulation.  I have stuck loyally to this red and white tube because it’s the best.  No plans to ever switch.  Have worn it in the warm Gulf of Mexico ocean and swimming pools and cried and wiped my eyes a lot (bad habit that used to give me instant racoon eyes)...yet it doesn’t smear or come off until you want it to.  I’ve slept in it accidentally more times than I want to admit and the worst that happens is my lashes get kind of bent and stuck together.  Still no smudges!  I love how the black, spindly, fuzzy SPIDER LEGS detach off my lashes easily as I gently roll them between my fingers with warm water.  Easy peasy. I haven’t used eye makeup remover since ‘09 or so.  I never have to worry about humidity ruining my eye makeup again.  Also if you mess up and get some on your skin or eyeshadow, just wait for it to dry and it easily can be flicked or scraped off with your fingernail or tweezer.  The white primer helps hold the curl and conditions my lashes.  Very conditioning!  This mascara holds and holds and holds.']"",['Holy Grail of mascaras!!!!!!  Humidity buster!!!']";;;;

The L'Oreal Double Extend Beauty Tubes Mascara stays on without smudging under my eyes, doesn't need any eyelid priming, and doesn't require removers to take off.  It's water resistant, stays on even when I'm sweating or tearing, and it stays put without requiring reapplication.  This mascara requires a two step application (a four step if you want to make the mascara more bold).  Simply swipe on the white primer on your lashes, then swipe the black color.  The result is thick and lengthened lashes.  While this doesn't make my eyelashes look as bold as other mascaras can, this one trumps them because it doesn't budge and it lasts all day without coming off.  To remove the mascara, simply wet your lashes with warm water, then lightly pull off your lashes - the mascara comes off in little tubes - they look like spider legs in your fingers!  Overall, this is the most convenient mascara I've used and I love the fact that it doesn't smudge off at all - it's definitely my go to mascara from now on!""""]"",""['No Smudging, Thickens and Lengthens Nicely, Easily Removed with Warm Water']""";;;;

However, it doesn\'t quite fill in the base of my lashes like my blue friend would. Once it is on and dried I like to go about my day and forget that it\'s even there. I also want to apply it as little as possible since I like to wake up and leave quickly.  I can\'t quite do that with this mascara. It makes my lashes feel heavy after awhile and while rain and light quickly moving water doesn\'t take of this mascara, everything else does. If I\'m laying down and the corner of my eyes water, the mascara there comes right off. If I grab a shower, it comes right off. I will say though that I much prefer the way that it comes off. Instead of the typical after shower raccoon eyes, it just slides right off. So while I don\'t like that going swimming, crying, or taking a shower will remove this """"waterproof"""" mascara, I much more prefer how it comes off.

"0,['4.0 out of 5 stars'],""['First and foremost, this is a mascara that does what it promises which is something unusual - it really does give the appearance of applying liner. The brush is unusual and I had to play around for a while to get the application right. It\'s shaped like a tapered V with a flat area and a single row of comb-style bristles on each edge of the applicator side. Rather than the usual brushing motion, what ended up working for me was a sort of """"pushing"""" motion, starting at the very base of my lashes one edge of the bristles touching my skin (I hope you can get the visual!). It took some practice and scraping a lot of excess mascara off the brush to achieve a clump-free application but once I did, the effect was fantastic. My upper lids looked lined and my lashes looked much longer. I haven\'t mastered lining my lower lashes yet and I\'m not sure I want to try but they look great with just a plain mascara application.', """"It's mostly smudge proof but the main problem I have is that this isn't waterproof.

"1,['5.0 out of 5 stars'],""[""""This is literally my favorite mascara. I understand why people can get frustrated with this mascara. It really depends on how you use it. While the mascara is straightforward and easy to use, I think it requires a little skill in applying it. You have to apply it lightly to avoid clumping and two layers is enough. Anything more than that would be too much since the mascara itself is really good at adding volume. Since it adds so much volume with the V-shape bristle, it's perfect for people who have fewer/shorter lashes. The product also stays on really well, all day, and I have no problem with it smudging. I will continue to buy this.""""]"",['Favorite']";;;;

I use the Telescopic Carbon Black in conjunction with this because of the clumping, but the volume and definition from this mascara is unbeatable. Definitely try and make sure you put some time into really making sure it gets onto your lashes and that you're getting the full effect from it because it will work. You just need to use the brush the right way! I don't always use another mascara with it, but it helps to get a different effect. This mascara alone will make your lashes look fake when applied correctly, at least it does for me.""""]"",['Just what my lashes need']";;;;

I have super pale blonde eyelashes, so it doesn't take much on my eyes to look dark. It doesn't have a brush, but two combs that apply a double dose in one stroke. It didn't go on as smoothly as a brush would, and I needed to use my eyelash brush to separate clumps. That is often the case with brand new mascara, though. But the combs weren't as easy to blot with a tissue before putting on. I'll be curious to see if there is a difference in the application once the mascara starts to run low.""""]"",['An interesting product']";;;;
